# The Epidemics
This is a private repository for the code used in Applied Cryptography.
The code in this repository was used by The Epidemics in Spring 2019.

## Layout
This repository contains three parts. The first is the files required for the various challenges given to us throughout the course. The second contains the programs and test files developed throughout the course. The final directory contains the files needed for our course project, which was a challenge using an encryption method that we developed during the course.
